This is a latex template for DTC user's guide originally created by Tim Brown, but heavily modified since then.

The style file used by this template (dtcdoc.sty) requires the CTAN LaTex extensions. Since these are not typically included in standard Linux installations, it is necessary to install a more modern LaTex distribution in order to compile this document.

For Windows users install the MiKTEX (http://www.miktex.org) distribution of LaTex.

For Mac users install the TEXâ€‰Live (http://tug.org/texlive/) installation and the TexShop (https://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/) front end GUI. Links and instructions for both should be available from the TexShop page.

To format the LaTex document, process the main file main.tex. It constists of include statements for the title, preface, appendices, chapters, etc whose content is contained in separate tex files such as forward.tex or dtc_ch1.tex. These files can't be compiled alone because they lack certain formatting statements which are only contained within main.tex.
