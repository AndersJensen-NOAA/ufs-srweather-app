# the ICs (specified in EXTRN_MDL_NAME_ICSSURF).  These variables (with
# corresponding descriptions) are:
#
# EXTRN_MDL_FILES_BASEDIR_ICSSURF:
# The base directory in which we will create subdirectories for each cy-
# cle in which to store the analysis and/or surface files generated by
# the external model for the ICs.  This directory will be created if if
# doesn't already exist.
#
# EXTRN_MDL_FILES_SYSBASEDIR_ICSSURF:
# The system directory (i.e. a location on disk, not on HPSS) in which
# the files generated by the external model for the ICs are stored (usu-
# ally for a limited time, e.g. for the FV3GFS external model, 2 weeks
# on WCOSS and 2 days on theia).  Note that this is a directory that al-
# ready exists on the specified machine; it is not a directory that is
# created by the FV3SAR workflow.  If for a given cycle start date and 
# hour the external model files are available in this system directory,
# they will be copied over to a cycle-dependent subdirectory under EX-
# TRN_MDL_FILES_BASEDIR_ICSSURF (which is the location where the preprocessing tasks
# that generate the IC and surface files look for these files.  If these
# files are not available in the system directory, then we search for 
# them elsewhere, e.g. in the mass store (HPSS).
